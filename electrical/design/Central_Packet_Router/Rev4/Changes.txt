Changes Needed For Rev 4.
	-Serial Connector has to be rotated, it is backwards on the current Rev.
	-A linear regulator has to be added to power the Beagle Bone from the 
	 shield, the power will be coming from a 9 volt switching regulator
	-All Uarts will remain the same except the Int will become the gps
	 Uart and because of this the Tripod and Video Transmitter will be connected
	 to the full sized usb on the beagle bone and an usb hub will be used
	 to communicate with them
	-(?)Do we want to assign certain GPIO ports to the solenoids and place 
	 them specially on the board?
	-Board Silk Screen must be updated and MUST be included in the order this time
	-Add GPIO connectors for solenoids
