The purpose of this test is to determine the appropriate method of termination for RS-485 signaling through CAT5 with the SN65HVD32 as
the signal source.

test1a.csv:
	Source Termination: NONE
	Load Termination: 100ohms
	Measurement: Load
	Notes: Almost no ringing. DC current draw 33mA.
test1b.csv:
	Source Termination: NONE
	Load Termination: 100ohms
	Measurement: Source
	Notes: Small overshoot, pretty much as good as it can be.

test2a.csv:
	Source Termination: NONE
	Load Termination: NONE
	Measurement: Load
	Notes: Ringing, 210mV of overshoot.
test2b.csv:
	Source Termination: NONE
	Load Termination: NONE
	Measurement: Source
	Notes: Ringing, 210mV of overshoot.
