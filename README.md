How this repository is organized
====================

Electrical board documentation
------------------------
This should all be in electrical/design/.
There should be a folder for each board, containing the datasheets for the parts on the board.
There should be PADS drawings, and PDFs of both the schematic and the layout, and a text file BOM.
There should be an explanation of what the board does, and a list of the commercial parts that
it connects to. If there is a good way of linking to the datasheets for these parts, then we
might do that as well.


Commercial parts
-------------------
Parts that aren't custom built (motors, sensors, motor controllers, etc) should be in documents.
These will be further organized by folder.

Currently there are some issues
------------------
Things aren't all where they should be, and often there's three places to look for something.
We're working on that.  However, I don't intend to touch the mechanical folder.
